Original RoboCop - a fictional cybernetic police officer - was following 3 prime directives which also drive the progress of Robocop linter:

## First Directive: Serve the public trust

Which lies behind the creation of the project - to serve developers and testers as a tool to build applications they can trust

## Second Directive: Protect the innocent

The innocent testers and developers have no intention to produce ugly code but sometimes, you know, it just happens, so Robocop is there to protect them

## Third Directive: Uphold the law

Following the coding guidelines established in the project are something very important to keep the code clean, readable and understandable by others and Robocop can help to uphold the law
